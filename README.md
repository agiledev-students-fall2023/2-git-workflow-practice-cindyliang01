I am interested by the article "[The Reason Why Recession Will Not Impact Software Developers?](https://medium.com/geekculture/the-reason-why-recession-will-not-impact-software-developers-c699ef2e3f4d)" because of the recent increase in tech industry layoffs. I have concerns that the economic recession might continue, potentially impacting my post-graduation job plans. It's discouraging to witness layoffs affecting many intelligent and hardworking individuals that I know. The article offers some reassurance that the recession might not significantly affect our plans, but I am still a little skeptical about its optimistic outlook. I am eager to hear your opinions on this matter.

__Sivan Cooperman__: While I couldn't read the entirety of the article since I                                       
don't have a Medium account, I agree that it is a little scary for me to be                                          
entering into the workforce this January in the midst of a depressed job market                                      
with soaring cost of living. However, even if prominent companies in the tech                                        
industries overhired etc. and needed to lay off employees, there are still                                           
plenty of companies (tech and non-tech) that are in need of software engineers.                                      
It might take a couple hundred applications, but I think jobs are still out                                          
there if you can find them.
