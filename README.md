I am interested by the article "[The Reason Why Recession Will Not Impact Software Developers?](https://medium.com/geekculture/the-reason-why-recession-will-not-impact-software-developers-c699ef2e3f4d)" because of the recent increase in tech industry layoffs. I have concerns that the economic recession might continue, potentially impacting my post-graduation job plans. It's discouraging to witness layoffs affecting many intelligent and hardworking individuals that I know. The article offers some reassurance that the recession might not significantly affect our plans, but I am still a little skeptical about its optimistic outlook. I am eager to hear your opinions on this matter.
